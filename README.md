Nova is a Lovable-style no-code builder with Solana wallet integration.  
It lets anyone build apps easily while paying for usage credits directly with their Solana wallet (SOL or USDC).  
Nova keeps the Web2 simplicity of Lovable while adding lightweight Web3 features like wallet payments and referral-based airdrops.  

(WEB3 PART IS YET TO BE ADDED INTO THE CODE)

## 🚩 Problem
AI-powered app builders like Lovable make it simple to generate apps, but payments are limited to Web2 rails (credit cards, Stripe, etc.).  
This excludes crypto-native users and offers no on-chain incentives for growth.  

---

## 💡 Solution
Nova bridges the gap by integrating the Solana wallet adapter for credit purchases.  
- Users can top up credits with **SOL/USDC**  
- Invite friends and earn **airdrop rewards** through referrals  
- Optional **wallet login** for Web3-native access

## ✨ Features
- No-code app builder (Lovable-style flow)  
- Credit system for usage  
- Pay with **Solana wallet (SOL/USDC)**

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- On-chain receipts for purchases  
- Tokenized credit vouchers (NFTs)  
- Web3-native app templates inside the builder
